    <p>A shopping cart web application is a software service that enables businesses to sell products online. With a shopping cart application, you can essentially build an online    marketplace and begin selling your product. There are varying types of this “eCommerce” software, some allow you to build an entire website from the ground up, others just    enable you to add a “store” tab to your existing website.</p>

	<p>So let's compare two of them. First, we will look at Shopify. Shopify is a huge eCommerce full service software. From online retail, with full website building capabilities, including marketing and search engine optimization, to analytics, and even a mobile app. Shopify does it all! Unfortunately for these kinds of amazing features, you will be paying $29/month and 2.9% + 30 cents per credit card transaction for the basic package. The premium package costing $299/month with similar rates for credit card processing.</p>

	<p>On the other hand, let's look at an open-source application called Xcart. Many times open-source is synonymous with free….. Not so much with Xcart.  The basic package is free, but has limited features. If you want to be able to process multiple currencies, have custom product tabs, compare products, manage reviews, etc. you will need to purchase a license. Xcart sells three different licenses, the more expensive, the more features you get obviously. Xcart is open-source, so you are able to add other features as your business grows in the future for a price, you aren't stuck with the license you buy if you want to upgrade. They have three licenses, $495, $1495, and $5995! However these are lifetime licenses.</p>

	<p>I’m sure there are free shopping cart apps or cheaper ones than these, but these two are both examples of applications that you can start a full scale online marketplace from scratch. As with most things, it comes down to what you really need. If you have a product or a service that sells itself, then investing is one of these products would be a good plan. Your company would be off the ground fast, with tested and working streamlined software to make sales a breeze. If you still need to build your brand before the sales are going to come pouring in, then this might be too much of an investment right up front.  There are so many options out there the choice is yours!</p>
