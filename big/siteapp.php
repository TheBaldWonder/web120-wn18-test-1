<p>There are two primary formats to reach the largest audience in the world! Yes you guessed it, I’m talking about smartphone users. Everyone wants to master this group of customers because everyone has a smartphone, and most people are always staring at them. What a huge captive audience! Then the only question remains is, how do we best reach them? How do we give them the best user experience? How do we keep them interested with most people having the attention span of a gnat now that they can instantly just look somewhere else if the don't see what they are looking for in the first nanosecond they look at something. So we must decide first if we should use a responsive website, or a mobile app.  Both have positive and negative aspects to them, so let's take a look at what i learned through my research.</p>
 
<p>A mobile app is perfect for regular and recurrent use since it remains on a user’s smartphone, unless manually deleted by the users themselves. It is a response to a specific need, while at the same time contributing to an increase in customer loyalty.</p>
        <ul>
                <li>Accessed after being installed</li>
                <li>Interactive user interface</li>
                <li>Available offline</li>
                <li>Can use smartphone features such as location, camera, etc.</li>
                <li>Time: Launching a mobile site is a faster process than designing an application. Nearly all businesses these days need mobile sites to stay competitive anyway, so creating a responsive mobile experience is the least that developers can do.</li>
                <li>Cost: Responsive web design is comparatively cheap when measured against the costs of designing a native mobile app from the ground up.</li>
        </ul>
 
<p>A mobile website is intended for mobile communication carrying the purpose of informing a large audience, with no specific time window, or for specific events and their promotion to a targeted audience, in a limited time frame.</p>
        <ul>
                <li>Accessed through web browser</li>
                <li>Static navigation user interface</li>
                <li>Requires data connection</li>
                <li>Somewhat limited features</li>
                <li>Functionality: Apps feature greater functionality than mobile-oriented sites can allow due to the way each is custom built into the device’s OS. This means that apps can easily integrate with other features and tools in a device as well as support functions that aren’t possible with web-based HTML5.</li>
                <li>Speed: Mobile apps are designed top to bottom with efficiency in mind. Apps usually have faster loading times than web pages as they aren’t cluttered with unnecessary site elements. The user experience is optimized.</li>
        </ul>
<p>So what is the best option? It comes down to what is best for your business. Nearly ever businesses already have a website, but there are ways to get the most out of your website and optimize it for mobile users without the cost of developing an app.A mobile app can be extremely powerful for marketing, streamlining the user experience, and reaching more diverse audiences. A good idea would to look at your budget and examine your realistic goals for your business and determine if it is a worthy investment investing the time and finances in developing a mobile app, or to contribute your funds to optimizing your current web space to reach more users of the mobile interface that is becoming ever more prominent each day.</p>
