<p> So what is Flexbox? Flexbox is a new mode is CSS3 used for designing layout.  Previous versions of CSS used 4 modes for layout: Block layout, inline layout, table layout, and positioned layout. Many web developers also made use of floats in their layout, but they were never intended to be used for layout and can be very buggy and limited in their features. The new Flexbox layout distributes space along a single column or row. Like float layouts, but better! The Flexbox spec is finished and enjoys excellent browser support today.  The final release was published in 2012 and except for IE9 (not sure who would HAVE to use IE9) works great in all browsers.</p>

<p>  The only benefit from using the old CSS block layouts and such is support for legacy browsers such as IE9 and other browsers that have mostly been forgotten. The cons are the need of complex css tricks, addition of extra html elements, pseudo elements and external js libraries to get results NOT AS GOOD as can be achieved in a single css line in flexbox.</p>

<p>  It seems that there are so many benefits from using something like Flexbox, or Bootstrap which, the newest version revamped all its grid implementations using the Flexbox model. Some of the reasons i am so excited about using Flexbox is: you can do your layout in any flow direction (even right o left or bottom to top!), you can flex the size of elements to respond to the available space, you can align elements with respect for their container or other elements, and elements can be laid out linearly along the main axis or wrapped in multiple lines along a cross axis.  It seems the limits for creativity have been lifted with the release of Flexbox!</p>
